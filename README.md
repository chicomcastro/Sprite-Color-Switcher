# Sprite-Color-Switcher
A little tool for changing sprites colors quickly on Unity by demand

## Instructions
### Step 1
Put the code on a functional script and give it to an generic object on scene (just while using Sprite-Color-Switcher).

### Step 2
Put all sprites you wanna change in MapsToChange public camp

### Step 3
Click on Unity gear on right top of your script component and click on "Setup Textures". Your color list should be populated by this with all color present in your sprites. You can see more information in Inspector Debug Mode (see https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/InspectorOptions.html)

### Step 4
Explore the colors list and choose all your replacement colors of desire.

### Step 5
Do the same as step 3, but clicking on "Switch colors". Done!
